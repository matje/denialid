Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that a certain
domain name does not exist. It is also used to signal that a domain name exists,
but does not have the specific RR type you were asking for. When returning a
negative DNSSEC response, a name server usually includes up to two NSEC records.
With NSEC3 this amount is three. This document provides extra documentation and
context on the mechanisms behind NSEC and NSEC3.
